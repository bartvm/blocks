class Checkpoint(SimpleExtension):
    """Saves a pickled version of the main loop to the disk.

    The pickled main loop can be later reloaded and training can be
    resumed.

    Makes a `SAVED_TO` record in the log with the serialization destination
    in the case of success and ``None`` in the case of failure. The
    value of the record is a tuple of paths to which saving was done
    (there can be more than one if the user added a condition
    with an argument, see :meth:`do` docs).

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        The destination path for pickling.
    add_to_dump : dict of objects
        A {'name': object} dictionnary of additional objects to save in
        the tar archive. Its keys will be used as name in the tar file.
    use_cpickle : bool
        See documentation of :func:`~blocks.serialization.dump`.

    Notes
    -----
    Using pickling for saving the whole main loop object comes with
    certain limitations:

    * Theano computation graphs build in the GPU-mode
      (`theano.config.device == "gpu"`) can not be used in the usual mode
      (and vice-versa). Therefore using this extension binds you to using
      only one kind of device.

class Load(TrainingExtension):
    """Loads a saved checkpoint into the main loop.

    Makes a `LOADED_FROM` record in the log with the dump path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        The path to the folder with dump.
    load_iteration_state : bool
        If `True`, load the iteration state. This can be useful when your
        model has very long epochs, and you want to resume when you were in
        the middle of one. Defaults to `False`.
    load_log : bool
        If `True`, load the old log and continue logging from there.
        Convenient because you end up with a single log of the entire
        training history. Defaults to `False`.

    Notes
    -----
    Requires the model to be created entirely using bricks, with a unique
    path/name for each brick, so that the parameters can be matched to
    their values.

    In order to load the iteration state and the log, the saved model needs
    to be unpickled. Note that resuming training this way is still not
    entirely seamless because e.g. extensions will not be reloaded.
